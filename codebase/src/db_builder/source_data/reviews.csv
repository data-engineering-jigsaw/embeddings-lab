30,Beyond Flavours,Pragya Sarda,"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",3,"9 Reviews , 8 Followers",5/20/2019 0:35,0,

43,Beyond Flavours,Sugandha Saxena,"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",4,"150 Reviews , 2135 Followers",5/18/2019 14:53,7,

45,Beyond Flavours,Sind Hu,The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table.

56,Beyond Flavours,Dyagamrahul,"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",3,"25 Reviews , 24 Followers",5/16/2019 7:13,0,

Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!

But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",2,"1 Review , 2 Followers",5/12/2019 8:37,0,

Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.",3,"20 Reviews , 23 Followers",5/12/2019 0:13,0,

79,Beyond Flavours,Vignesh Rk,"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.",1,"13 Reviews , 67 Followers",5/11/2019 10:06,6,

84,Beyond Flavours,Sreshta Ladegaam,"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",1,"25 Reviews , 722 Followers",5/9/2019 12:37,0,

Chicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible
Chicken biryani: 3/5
Garlic naan: 2/5

201,Flechazo,Jalaj Goyal,"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

218,Flechazo,Fairina Siddiqui,"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",1,"4 Reviews , 3 Followers",5/17/2019 18:43,3,

220,Flechazo,Sneha Battula,"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

235,Flechazo,Rajsi Gaikwad,"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.

248,Flechazo,Rupayan Banerjee,It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.,2,"11 Reviews , 80 Followers",5/1/2019 22:57,0,

To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.,5,"22 Reviews , 171 Followers",5/22/2019 19:07,0,

You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.

Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.",1,"1 Review , 2 Followers",5/8/2019 2:35,1,

It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.

371,Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,DieEating,"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

Food : 4.5/5
Service : 4/5

375,Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Arpa Ghosh,"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!",4,"32 Reviews , 70 Followers",3/30/2019 11:09,3,

One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.

But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though.

485,Over The Moon Brew Company,Devina Mohan,"Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us.

505,The Fisherman's Wharf,Arpa Ghosh,"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

507,The Fisherman's Wharf,Deepak Raj,"One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

Food: Delicious. Exotic. Hygienic. We tried lobster, prawns and red wine. We wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. Maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. You may not get all the items listed. 10/10

Ambiance: Beautiful. Live music. Great lightening. For parties and a nice dinner. 8/10

Service: Satisfied. They prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. Waiters were polite and nice. They served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. It was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10",5,"14 Reviews , 2 Followers",4/22/2019 16:03,6,

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!

585,The Fisherman's Wharf,Shishir,"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.

Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied.

# taste, quality are great

# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140.

I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. Hope they keep inspiring us :)",4,"42 Reviews , 1384 Followers",3/11/2019 22:08,3,

670,eat.fit,Gael D'Marte,"AVOID. This place is a scam. If there is even a place: I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. Anyway, I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.",1,1 Review,3/11/2019 0:10,0,

673,eat.fit,Sai Dev,"I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed

Taste 4.5/5
Packaging 4/5

762,Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma,Kaushik Padmanaban,"Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!",4,"11 Reviews , 7 Followers",12/9/2018 20:34,0,

Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.",4,"119 Reviews , 469 Followers",12/4/2018 10:52,0,

Really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti.

807,Hyper Local,Food&Bikes (FaB),"Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.",4,"54 Reviews , 74 Followers",5/14/2019 20:19,16,

I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience.

# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience

822,Hyper Local,Vibhor Dhote,"I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.

Also the live music there wasn't great.",3,"63 Reviews , 260 Followers",5/4/2019 20:00,1,

1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

I dicided to give it another shot and came again.

2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience.",2,"12 Reviews , 48 Followers",5/3/2019 21:56,0,

The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

Ambience :- They have both indoor and outdoor seating as well , indoor was totally chilled and relaxed place where we have screening going on any movies or songs as it is IPL season mostly we can get to see the match screening .

836,Hyper Local,Moumita Ghosh,"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",5,"16 Reviews , 668 Followers",4/24/2019 17:23,5,

838,Hyper Local,Suparna Banerjee,"Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ

I ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.

It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.",4,"72 Reviews , 2050 Followers",4/23/2019 21:43,5,

861,Hyper Local,Anmol Singh,"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

Be aware people. Avoid this place.",1,"6 Reviews , 59 Followers",4/6/2019 12:16,0,
862,Hyper Local,Sanika Samant,"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
The music was extremely loud for the place.
Overall we had a below average Experience.

In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever.",1,"98 Reviews , 407 Followers",4/1/2019 10:42,0,

885,Hyper Local,Shreshth Malhotra,"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)",3,"275 Reviews , 1989 Followers",3/25/2019 15:50,0,
886,Hyper Local,Tavleen Kaur Gandhi,"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.

The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak Hindi.

IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate.

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.
The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.

If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable.

I recently visited Sardarji's and tried lot of items of it

Gol Gappe (3.5/5)
Gol gappes were good but the Paani can be made more tangy.They only have one varieties of Paani,and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it.

Aloo Tikki (4/5)
Aloo Tikki was very good. Red and green chutneys were perfect.

Samosa (4/5)

Chole Bhatoore (5/5)
Chole Bhatoore were amazing.Do eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at home.Choles are also very tasty.

The sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. 
However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes.

I was pretty excited to try out their Ramadan special menu and the moment I enter I see a Big Raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot Mutton Chops searing on ghee! That view Enticed me and I just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. I couldn't wait to try that Super appetising Chops and delicious Raan!

Besides they also got chicken Shawarma and MUTTON HALEEM Which is another different delicacy storyline...
I had to take a big bowl of Haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and Final touch with Two spoons of Ghee. Yes that's my style! üòâ

I walked to see few more exciting dishes and I found the legendary Badami Gosht! Yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides Murgh Mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...

Cannot miss Thier Gosht Biryani üòã one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. Perfectly tender meat and soft and Fragrant basmati with a touch of Ghee!

Only because of the taste and being foodie I had two rounds of everything and was full...
But there's always a another stomach for kulfi!

1102,Barbeque Nation,Vinay Srivastava,"Have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013. Have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.
This Gachibowli BBQ Nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn‚Äôt available in any other location I have been to.
The staff is extremely courteous. We were served by Rajib, who was really warm, quick in his service.
The overall quality of the food was satisfying, just like most of the other outlets I‚Äôve been to.",4,"68 Reviews , 185 Followers",5/5/2019 17:13,4,
1103,Barbeque Nation,Gourmet Hunter,"As usual it's fab place to have grill in a buffet. Non veg is awesome here. Chicken, Mutton, Prawns, Fish are served on the grill. Some days you also get crab curry. Now they opened tawa starters as well.

Nice place to go for team lunch/dinner.",5,"231 Reviews , 407 Followers",5/4/2019 13:58,7,
1104,Barbeque Nation,The Food O‚ÄôClock,"Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.

Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.

AC facility was good, very cold.

But I don‚Äôt recommend this place.",2,"25 Reviews , 13 Followers",5/3/2019 15:36,0,

1111,Barbeque Nation,Anirudh Bhattacharjee,"I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",3,"24 Reviews , 41 Followers",3/29/2019 17:36,0,

I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.",4,"4 Reviews , 1 Follower",3/3/2019 17:54,0,

We were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.

In short, it wasn't value for money. 

I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy.",3,"1 Review , 38 Followers",2/8/2019 16:53,0,

Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. Has a lag in my order when I had been there last time but I guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine.

1131,Barbeque Nation,Purnima Powell,"Early Christmas celebrations. we were dressed up and wanted fine dine. We were told that Barbeque Nation is always booked, we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 9:30.
From the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...I must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.
The Starters were amazing....I love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
But their Prawns are the best grilled prawns I ever tasted. They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course.... My personal favs were Grilled Prawns and RoseMary Chicken...mmm..  mmm... mmmmm yummy !!!!

Ambiance : good enough
Service : the staff were all very polite but a bit slow

The taste of food was very good. They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. Over all the experience was very good.

1141,Barbeque Nation,Sidhant Girglani,"We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.",1,"22 Reviews , 17 Followers",11/29/2018 1:50,0,

Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.

Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted.

1154,Barbeque Nation,Epicure,"To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section.

1156,Barbeque Nation,Rabia Sultana,"I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That‚Äôs what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.",2,"10 Reviews , 2 Followers",10/9/2018 21:06,2,

1164,Barbeque Nation,Esli Jacinth,"This was my first time at a ""Barbeque Nation."" I've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.
Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.
The good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.

1170,Barbeque Nation,Age Of Foodies (Suraj Karambe),"Unlimited BBQ food with delicious desserts-
Ambiance-
Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.
Food-
As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
Service-

1179,Barbeque Nation,Vedant Killa,"Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.

Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.

I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.

Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. üòçüò¨ there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.

- slippery floor .. be careful when you good with high heels or children. Perhaps they don't have time to clean it up to reach standards of safe place
- bathrooms meant for rotten rats... Dirty washroom and tiny doors. Hefties and jumbo sizes, you can't get in
- service ... Ohhh they can't handle crowd from 8 pm till the place starts getting filled up. For sure you will get feel of crowded market where waiters shout and chatter, but service time and order time is pathetic.
- advance bookings ... They don't understand what means advance booking as soon as u step in
- pan kulfi... It should rather be named as sugar syrup topped with milk and green color. Pathetic and not worth giving tough time to your taste buds.",2.5,"2 Reviews , 3 Followers",6/23/2018 14:54,0,

I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.

Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.

I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",2,"146 Reviews , 333 Followers",4/8/2019 23:54,1,

While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
Service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!.

I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded.

1314,The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Poonam Nanda Ghosh,"It was a night out with gal pals.

When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.

Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.

They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.

The server came and took our orders.

We ordered starters and drinks.

As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.

It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.

Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.

Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.

Anyways moving on

The cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.

The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.

The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.

Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.

Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.

Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn‚Äôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).

We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.

Singapore Noodles - 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5
Chicken Wet - 4/5

They didn‚Äôt have pizza on the day we went.

Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.

Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

It's all based on the demand and supply that day!
A large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. All you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.

The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience.

What's great? Nothing.

It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.

The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.

Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.

Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.

We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).

It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.

1370,The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Kanika Gautam,"Have been to this place...

Ambience - took up the seat in the outdoor area... loved the place and the music beats....

Service - staff person was Santosh. He was very efficient and courteous.

Food - ordered white sauce pasta, misal pav, bombay sandwich and drinks.

Misal pav is great but a suggestion here. Increase the quantity of misal in the plate. The taste was real good.

Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.

Bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..

Definitely must visit place..",5,"22 Reviews , 14 Followers",4/2/2019 18:49,0,

The lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. It's very crowded on weekends like anything

Talking about the food this place is Zomato Gold Food partner. If you have it , you can enjoy the benefits
- Chicken Lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
- Masala Papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
- cheesy pineapple sticks (Never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(
- Paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)
- Chicken Tikka Masala (highly recommended)
- Cheese Garlic naan and butter Naan

Overall my evening at Lal was just amazing, the service was really good. You can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17",4,"202 Reviews , 1192 Followers",4/1/2019 14:29,4,
1374,The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Vineet R,"This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.

Now coming to F&B, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. Every thing we ordered in Veg, Non Veg and Drinks (Mocktails) we're really good... Music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all I believe Wednesday is Ladies Night... So all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)

Today I went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.

1386,The Lal Street - Bar Exchange,Rishab Singhal,"What an ambience. It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place.
It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. We could order ourselves from the app.

The Lal Street (to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). 

In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)

If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. 

It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.",4,"65 Reviews , 375 Followers",3/19/2019 9:14,2,

Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks.

They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

To be honest it didn't live up to the great reviews and great reputation it has.

Quality of food is not wow but very average, prawn barbeque and chicken was very average.

My frnds nd me too could sense a foul smell as if it was nt fresh. Coming to the special items duck, rabbit squid, quail was on live and the chef cooked all the items in same way in same sauce. So i couldn't just feel the difference between all those special to be dishes. The place is nt properly built as i could smell the smoke of cooking and burning as well.

The store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..

Staff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to üçî burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..

But over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes

1627,NorFest - The Dhaba,Vivek Jain,"The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.

I'm a big fan of this place and love their combos.
Ordered their Veg. Galouti Kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
Was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

Then came the Veg. Combo - Had 2 butter rotis with Mixed Veg curry (Corn, carrot, Peas, capsicum, potato, Aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
Absolutely loved the mixed Veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani üòÅ with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless üòä

Norfest is now operational in PVR Galleria, Punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location üòä

Their Paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

1648,NorFest - The Dhaba,Surya,"Ordered today veg thali via Uber eats. Was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. On the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. Below item wise feedback:
Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

Taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. In non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. VFM 1/5.  
They are not providing drinking water. A eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
I have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%.",1,"28 Reviews , 64 Followers",9/15/2018 15:01,0,
1655,NorFest - The Dhaba,Rubin S Cherian,"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

1668,NorFest - The Dhaba,Roohi Najiya,"‚ö´Ô∏è This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
‚Çπ269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èKadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èDum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èBundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ‚ù£ I think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èRice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èButter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSalad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èKheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

First, coming to the people who spoke about ""Authentic Punjabi"" food in reviews, guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit Punjab and eat there!
Shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal, Lassi was the worst one I have had lately. The Amritsari Kulcha and Chole was tasteless. The dollop of ""Butter"" didnt taste as it was meant to.

1676,NorFest - The Dhaba,Varun,"Have been there several times and have opted for delivery too.

They serve pretty good authentic North Indian food. Mutton Rogan Josh, Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni are top notch. Very flavorful and authentic.

Galaouti Kebabs are by far the best item in the menu.

Story goes that one particular Nawab of Lucknow, who was an infamous couch potato, had lost the use of his dentures and was looking for something pate style, which needed no chewing yet imparted the flavors of a fine kebab. So Galaouti‚Äòs were invented.

And the mutton Galaouti‚Äôs served here, are exactly like mentioned above. Very soft not much chewing required, they just melt in the mouth. They are served with ulta tawa paratha's and is a must must try.

Pricing is very economical and occasionally they offer 50% discount too over Uber eats.So, if u have a thing for North Indian cuisine it's a nice place to go.",4,"27 Reviews , 21 Followers",7/8/2018 1:36,0,

I have tasted almost every item here, like paneer butter masala, matar mushroom, Dal makhni, Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Lucknowi chicken dum pulav, murgh tikka masala, Punjabi special veg / non-veg Thali, rajma chawal etc.,
My best picks are matar mushroom, paneer butter masala, Punjabi special veg Thali, punjabi butter chicken to name a few.
I was disappointed with the Rajma chawal though.

The best thing about this place is its consistency in taste which it maintains.

Only things I‚Äôd complain about would be Pudina Chutney and the quantity of rice.

Coming to the food, we ordered paneer combo in which they serve paneer curry, rice, dal makhni and 2 roti. Quantity is sufficient for 1 person. The best part of the meal was their dal makhni. it was just wow. paneer curry was good in taste but it had little strong flavour of tadka.

I also had amritsari kulcha with chole. It was good in taste. Also, tried their lassi and sikanji. lassi was delicious but sikanji was totally opposite. It was not refreshing as it should be.

Overall, we had nice experience, and recommendable place to have food in SLN terminus.

1698,NorFest - The Dhaba,Daenarys,"The spare get five in this judging world where every mere mortal, including me, set about while writing a review, scrutinize every bite we took and every sense we had.
On such a rare occasion, i commemorate this restaurant with invisible gardens and gold because it definitely is worth spending your hard earned me for a sensation like this.
Since the time i shifted to Hyderabad, i have had trouble finding the less is more concept in a restaurant.
Spicy, hot and tangy became a common thing. And here comes Norfest, like a strong and quiet gallant hero, who quietly watches the bustle in the world and only comes when called upon.

The mutton galauti kebabs took me back to the streets of husainganj in lko where, street food sellers scream in the humid heat, ushering people to come in to their food haven. It was soft and melting in your mouth and i didnt have to be physically placed in lko again. The nuts on top were a nice touch.

We also ordered for a non veg thali which had butter chicken and I, a slow eater, finished it in seconds. I still remember the taste in my mouth, tandoori chicken, soft and creamy gravy with warm rice.
The dal makhani, i presumed would have the sane taste as the butter chicken, but it had a more coherent flavor of the dal and solely made with the lentil and no rajma was added.
I, a pure non vegetarian, became a fan of the veggie curry with cooked capsicums, carrots and corn. The gravy enveloping it was amazing.
The thali was so well packed that nothing had spilled out and touched any other item when i opened it.
The kheer was the perfect stop for this sensations insued trip.
It was sweet, the rice had formed a beautiful serene sort of bond with the milk and the saffron gave it a nice fresh touch.
Talking about it, i am definitely reordering it tomorrow. Kudos",5,"115 Reviews , 4025 Followers",5/30/2018 1:03,0,

1824,10 Downing Street,Hungry Soul,"Vegetarian Review ~

This is my go to place when I randomly decide to go out to grab some brewed beer. I don't remember how many times I have been here. On the 10th floor, the view from the outdoor seating is beautiful, the indoor is nice and lavishly yet elegantly decorated, though I personally like outdoors. The dance floor is a little small but hey the DJ has to be good right!!

With their whole ranged of brewed beers - 4 different samples to try out and one can order a sample of all to taste and decide. I like ale above all. We combined it with honey chilli potato, dahi ke kababs, baby corn tempura.
Honey chilli patao has great spicy and sweet balance but a bit of onion to the fry would have made it a best dish.
Dahi ke kabas were good to taste with the green chutney.
Lasagne is good and pasta is so so and I didn't like it that much. Food is average here but a glass of beer and one won't mind. Wines are not that great too so go for beer üòú

The staff is good and friendly. The price is a bit on expensive side I would say. There are minimal cover charges for the pub. The embience is feel good and enjoy the night away kinda so it's fun.

The DJ is amazing and I always had great time shaking my leg on the floor. So it's a must go if u still haven't been here. üòç",4,"175 Reviews , 1302 Followers",4/6/2019 18:52,6,

You would change your opinion about 10D if you visit this place in Gachibowli.
Rooftop open air ambience, with comfy seating.
Service is faster compared to many other pubs in the neighborhood even though it's jam packed on a Friday night. They also have a separate section of seating for those who wish to sit and talk serious business, away from the music. The entire hotel which is on the 10th floor has got a royal and classy look.
Staff are courteous and know their menu well. Do ask them for suggestions if you're confused on which ones to choose.
It's got a separate dance floor and Bollywood on the clock after 11 is awesome! They play these retro vibes which all the 90s born adults would love!
Overall it's one of the best I've visited in a long time, will definitely be on my frequent visit list.
Tip : Do try their in-house beers, there are 4 varieties of them. You can get a sample tray of all flavours, so that you can taste each type and choose whichever you like.",4,"70 Reviews , 776 Followers",3/9/2019 3:54,0,

The weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.

In drinks, we had Hot toddy, Brewed beer, Fruit punch, Pinnacolada and many other mocktails. All of these were good but there was nothing special about them.

In food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom Tikka, fish and chicken wings.

Loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.

We tried veg platter for starters which was delicious. The quantities was just right for two people.

We enjoyed some mocktails alongside and a bowl of corns.

The place is a bit expensive but I think it's worth it as we loved the food and the ambiance.

We certainly would love to revisit it on a date night and enjoy the rooftop experience. At the time we went the rooftop was closed as some renovations were going on.

1850,10 Downing Street,Anupam Agarwal,"Being close to my house SLN Terminus is one place I have often visited be it Serifina ( that got closed) or the Lal Street or mystery rooms or 10D . It's a happening place and worth a visit.

Have been to 10D quiet a few times and the experience has been mixed from a 2 star rating to probably as high as a 4.5 star. I would say a lot depends on the day you are visiting.

We visited once over a weekend, once during the Christmas time and once when there was a ladies night. The best experience we had was on a weekend and the worse during the ladies night probably due to the crowd that comes.

Ambiance - the place is really nice and has quiet a few sections. My favorite is the outside seating but if u reach late it will probably be full by then.

Service - if the number of people are less then the service is nothing short of amazing but when it's crowded , and if u are not it in a large group you will probably feel neglected at times. The staff is courteous and quick to attend

Food - Definitely not something to talk about in the place as it is more of a party place where you can drink dance and have an amazing time. food is ok and will not disappoint u.

Drinks - there is definitely something for the beer lovers here and LIIT is worth giving a try

Overall a good place to hangout and party just probably choose the day you want to go
Friday night or Sunday night is what I would recommend. And yes the more the merrier... You are definitely going to enjoy if it's a group.

I dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because I do not think I will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick. I will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick, I can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong Ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and I am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of Jan I never fell sick with the strong Ale it was on the 13th that my friend and I fell sick . Second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? Your staff would stand on my head to make sure I am not smoking pot and are you serious?? I use fresh tobacco like American Spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot, I feel humilated.

This 10D is unique in it's own ways and has a brewery unit attached to it so it is a bonus in terms of the variety on offer for the alcoholics.
Have been to this place on a few occasions once to taste the brews and another visit was for a pub lunch which comes with a glass of draught beer.
My suggestions: Chicken lasagne, Shepard's pie,Roast lamb and a lot more
Must admit the pub lunch here is one of the best and the brews are brilliant to pair with some food.

I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations.
The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that! It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live!
Coming to food and service, I would rate it 1/5. We tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. We had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark. The service was literally horrible, being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess ü§£ü§™

The ambience of the place is great and so was the hospitality.
Coming to food, ordered two non veg platters, all the items in the platter were great but when the quantity is compared to the cost,its little disappointing but they entirely make it up with their taste and quality. Beers were good, but they not at all strong, we can drink it like cold water.
The main course was spread across continental, Chinese and indian. From continental side, we ordered pasta, lasagne and a fish. Again the quantity was less but quality was great. From chinese we ordered chicken bamboo rice along with prawns.In indian we ordered, peshawari chicken, nawabi chicken, punjabi chicken. All these main course had complimentary drinks and deserts.

The main thing about this place is it is a place to hangout or go for a date but not a place to for team lunch. Best enjoyed when visited with max 3-4 ppl.

Most of the gravies taste same and brown in color. Overall worth a visit. Good place to enjoy music and have fun.,4,"2 Reviews , 2 Followers",10/29/2018 19:29,0,

Starting from the reception area *( especially that guy with a moustache... You made the night with your behavior).
After entering the lounge, it kinda of creates a pleasant view with all the interior decorations.
The service was good starting from the starters to the drinks and main course and finally the desserts.
But at the end of the night it was the DJ guy who outperformed everyone. You will be the one who will make me to come to this place again and again. Being from North India, finally got the chance to dance to those Punjabi songs listening to which I have grown. Danced with the heart in my palm. Needless to say that the DJ guy was the icing on the cake with his song selections.

Ordered few Kababs, Biriyani, Nan, Panner 
Value for money.
Quantity is good.
Taste : We specifically told the manager to server less spicy items and my parents really liked the kabab items and a chicken main course.
Service : That time I think only 4-5 table filled. But they are very late in serving and the waiter even not listening after a multiple time about serving (e.g veg  or non-veg. No rice to parent). He just did what he thought. Then I started to serve till manger came for rescue..ha ha... 1 star less for this. In one word it's un-professionalism.
Service time : Good, timely delivered the ordered items.

Checked out the menu and found Chicken Afghani, Pepper chicken to be their favorites. Ordered these, though ZOMATO, however, ZOMATO RUINED IT with delivery part the food was worth the wait.

The Chicken Afghani was spicy and went well with steamed rice. The pepper chicken was bit over fried, however, tasty with right blend of species.

The gravy was unique because i had Chicken Afghani in other restaurants but Pakwaan has their own way of presenting it.

Overall it was a wholesome meal for 2 of us.

2067,13 Dhaba,Mayank,The overall taste is good and I recommend Paneer Thali which is both reasonable and yummy.

2068,13 Dhaba,The Binge Journal,"We had been wanting to visit 13 Dhaba for quite some time, having heard the raving reviews about their North Indian preparations. Finally ended up trying their steaming hot, gobsmacking parathas and they're truly some of the best you can find in Hyderabad üòç

The Aloo Tawa Paratha is actually stuffed with loads of filling as compared to other places that serve doughy parathas. The Paneer kulcha was also smothered in butter and served with onions and curd.
We ordered the small Aloo Paratha but it was ginormous and we were almost full by the time we were done with it ü§≠

On My Plate: Buttery Aloo Paratha||Paneer Makhani||Raita

The Paratha that you see is just one half of the entire paratha. So imagine how ginormous is. The stuffing was perfect, neither too less, nor too much. The paneer was very softly cooked and absorbed the flavors of the spices, and the gravy too was amazing.

The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

LETS begin with drinks first

They served so many MOCKTAILS like

ORANGE DELIGHT had amazing blend of vit C to give u the boost in this hot weather

CUCUMBER n MINT very refreshing to beat the heat n taste was good too

VIRGIN PINA COLADA not good as it had coconut n pineapple flavor n I'm not a fan of coconut flavor especially in drinks,so it was a No No for me

BLACK CURRANT tasted good

SPICY TANGO had a tinge of masala like jaljeera n a dash of spiciness dat had a pinching sensation on the throat.....little different n can be taken

BLUE LAGOON as the name says it's a blue colored drink dat had blue caracao syrup added with few lemon wedges n mint leaves.....tasted realllllyyy good

FOOD

GRILLED POMFRET
a big fat good looking pomfretüòã marinated with an awsome blend of very basic n flavorful spices n grilled to perfection....served with mint yogurt dip along with onion rings n lemon wedges.......fish was full of flavors with each bite giving superb taste n it was fresh as the taste of fish meat was very good n not at all smelly......well presented n deliciousüëå

CHILLI CHICKEN
Chunks of boneless chicken coated with batter n fried till golden brown,tossed in a chilli soy based sauce with onion,cubed capsicum,dry red chillies n spring onion stalks topped with handful of cashews n raw cabbage.....overall tasted very good n chicken was perfectly cooked n the sauce that was coating it was fab too...

CRISPY CORN
Crunchy corn topped with some garlic n onions is the best of anything that one could possibly desire for........ if you love crispy corn then u you cannot miss this.....it was a fantastic appetizer to start our meal with.......do not miss this guyzz üëç

THAI BASIL CHICKEN WINGS
When chicken wings are coated in a delicious schezwan style thai chilli garlic sauce with a touch of basil leaves u get an awsome result.....it was very different kinda wings which we don't usually get at other places.......delicious

CHICKEN WONTON
Minced chicken filling wrapped in wonton sheets served with sweet chilli dip......filling had a quite dominant flavor of vinegar otherwise it was fine.....

NAWABI SHIKAMPURI KEBAB
Usually shikampur is flat round shape n filled with yogurt,but here it was in a round ball shape filled with yogurt n onion dip.....shikampur was cooked very well n was going very well with the mint sahi chutney n onions on the side...

DRAGON PRAWNS
Crispy fried prawns tossed in red chili n garlic sauce

BUTTER GARLIC PRAWNS
By far one of the best butter garlic prawns I had till now.....crispy fried prawns tossed in a velvety buttery n garlicky sauce with onions n spring onion stalks topped with sesame seeds n raw cabbage......üëå

TIGER PRAWNS
Jumbo is also a small word to describe the size of these prawns....whoa mahn!!!!
Tiger prawns was the right name given to this dish as the prawns sized huge....tossed in a very basic garlic,salt n pepper sauce served on a bed of blanched spinach topped with lemon wedge.....it was a bit hard but other than that the flavors were good

DAL TADKA
Well blended with perfect tempering of dry red chillies,chopped garlic,cumin seeds n oil.....was one of my favorite from the main course items.....delicious

RARA GOSHT
Minced meat gravy dat was delicious n spices did not overpower the whole dish which was the best part of this dish

BUTTER NAAN n AMRISTSARI KULCHA tasted yummmmm

BURNT FRIED RICE WITH SCHEZWAN CHICKEN GRAVY
This combo can never go wrong.....both the dishes complimented each other n it tasted fab!!!

DESSERTS

GULAB JAMUN
Perfect rounds of gulab jamun served with sugar syrup n sprinkled with chopped almonds wer yummmmmm
Perfectly cooked with just the right color

CREME BRULEE
It consists of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar....... it was served slightly chilled topped with plenty of fruit cuts n presented with apple slices by the side.......
It was different from other places n tasted yummm

CHOCOLATE FONDANT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM
When a warm choco lava cake is topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with loadz of chocolate sauce n dusted with powdered sugar den there is nothing else u want in ur lifeüòã

SERVICE was on point.....staff was very polite n humble
Delivered each n every item with punctuality n was never rude even if we asked something too many times....good team

However I have never had the buffet so I wouldn‚Äôt comment on the taste, but the spread is definitely good cz I checked that out. I come here and order right out of the menu and over time have fallen in love with their Fish items from the grill section. I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin. Apart from their fish I love their Spring Chicken and Chicken Confit as well. If you love grilled meat that is cooked delicately in continental cooking style, then this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit.

Coming to the ambiance, it‚Äôs minimalistic and chic. The staff is polite and warm. They have a Zomato gold offer on food, so that‚Äôs amazing because the food is a little on the pricier side. I definitely plan to have their buffet soon and will update this post accordingly.",5,"21 Reviews , 58 Followers",3/28/2019 14:30,2,

Brunch- They do have a hell variety of items and I am sure you won't be able to taste them all...I liked their starters very much which had egg options, pan cakes, sautee vegetables, idly, dosa and many more.It was fulfilling in itself.If you also love brunch than it is definitely worth trying and value for money.

Dessert- I went their only for dessert once and had Tiramisu and chocolate ganache...both of them tasted amazing...except Tiramisu base was little watery after sometime but still it managed to satisfy my craving.

2138,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Foodbite,"Best place Ever Jonathan's Kitchen

If you are near Gachibowli and are planning to have a perfect lunch or dinner so I recommend you the best place is Jonathan's kitchen, where you can visit with your family and friends. I really loved this place from it‚Äôs ambiance to food and service, everything‚Äôs top notch.

It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.

Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn‚Äôt much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo‚Äôs before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!

Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.

Then we ordered some mocktails because it‚Äôs mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.

Then it‚Äôs time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.

But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.

Thanks to Mr. Rashid for the lovely dinner at Jonathan's kitchen. Thanks to the entire team of Jonathan's kitchen who served us in a very good way and special thanks to Surrender and Chef vijay.

Huge disappointment this one was.Been here for lunch on holiday,even though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a table.Service, i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it's understandable and afterall they are human.This one was unacceptable.It was a buffet(everything selfservice) only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple times.I walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6.üòÇThe taste of the food in the buffet,total off.Below average spread and taste.Nothing caught my attention to even write about it.The kebabs were all dry,the classic crispy corn was rock hard .The fish curry,i think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravy.Why is it so hyped,i still don't get it.May be i visited this on restaurent's bad day.But it was a bad lunch day for me and my friends.We just know how to have fun in the crisis,good for us,otherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment.",2,"85 Reviews , 673 Followers",3/24/2019 14:34,0,
2143,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Mohammed Asim Khan,"One of Hyderabad's most stylish fine dining places, Jonathan's Kitchen serves lip-smacking culinary delights paired up with a cool and extensive bar menu. The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.

We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.

Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.

We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.

Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.

We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.",5,"57 Reviews , 1123 Followers",3/22/2019 15:03,8,

We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good.

2149,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Suraj Soni,"Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk againüòú",2,"11 Reviews , 3 Followers",3/13/2019 21:45,0,

As main course we ordered salmon steak which was really the size of a steak with vegetables and creamy sauce. I, like usual , ordered Indian cuisine which was butter naan and chicken tikka masala which was really suffice for me. The taste was also good.

Quality of Food: 5/5 Simply premium.Items I like the most are veg. maki (sushi), broccoli salad* from their regular menu.But even more outstanding are their live counter options such as Tawa Fish (Not your regular bland bone-less fish, but the way you eat fish at home) had some real flavour. Omelette, French toast, Pancakes were simply brilliant.
Variety of Food: 5/5 Enormous.This is where Jonathan's Kitchen truly excels, there has to be at least one item you will madly fall in love with. They claim to have over 60 items on their menu, which can be verified rather immediately upon looking at the serving table.
#In the name of unlimited drinks, there was no real variety to choose from. I couldn't even get my favourite soft drink Thums up (Franchise issue probably, I know), and on that particular day, there wasn't any option of Pina Colada.

2162,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Rajjit Das,"I went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Four of us were there for lunch, out of four two of us opted for the sunday brunch and the other two went for √† la carte. I was among the two who went for √† la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.
Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the √† la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of saut√©d spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.
Overall, it's a great place to visit which serves dishes from all the major cuisines around the world.",4,"17 Reviews , 399 Followers",3/1/2019 20:11,2,

2169,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Hungry Eyes,"This review has been long overdue, I visited this place for my birthday and gawd I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all !! The place has this really sophisticated minimal design which isn‚Äôt too catchy but kinda looks like an elite ball room dining room.
The service is just amazing ! Every staff member that approaches the table knows the menu in and out, the warmth that they have just gives this place extra points.
Now coming to the main aspect of this restaurant; the food. The food is as authentic as it can get and this goes for every cuisine that the restaurant offers be it Mediterranean or Italian as a matter of fact even Indian.
Now I don‚Äôt want to go into detail with all that I ordered and describe it, I‚Äôll attach images with this review and I‚Äôll let the images talk for themselves albeit I‚Äôd like to describe a few dishes because those dishes deserve credit- to begin with I‚Äôd like to talk about the pizza, this was one of the finest pizzas I‚Äôve ever had in Hyderabad, drizzled with a tad bit of olive oil and perfectly seasoned.
Moving forward I‚Äôd like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I‚Äôd have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.
To summarize this I‚Äôd say yes this place is a must visit and I‚Äôd definitely recommend it for any formal or casual occasion be it birthdays or cooperate dinners, this place is the place to be !!",5,"104 Reviews , 5129 Followers",2/17/2019 13:02,4,

surprisingly the entire place was empty and we were the only customers there

so, it was a very cozy comfy yummy and lovely experience.

the food was good, service was ok (surprisingly!!!), price is also okish
(a bit pricey u can say)
rating - 3 * coz the waiters/servers who were COMPLETELY free n unoccupied were continously busy huddling up in a corner n chatting with each other, i thought i would be getting that attention since i was the only customer there but sadly no. they were enjoying the free time rather than provide some excellent service.

Ambience is good with cool music and performance.
Service ok.
Food not satisfied.
My review is only on vegetarian food.
Starters:
There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
Live counter:
Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.
Main course:
I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me. In general, I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive.",3,"73 Reviews , 380 Followers",2/6/2019 13:40,9,

2185,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun Saraf,"This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember. I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu.

Cons...
Asked for Nan and we got it when we already finished our lunch.

2191,Jonathan's Kitchen - Holiday Inn Express & Suites,Varun K,"One of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark!

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...

Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!

The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!

VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Ambience, service and location of this place is spot on..
Choice of menu is less and am sure they are clear about their strengths and they have curated the menu accordingly. Right balance of Indian, Chinese, etc
We ordered a Chicken starter which is very flavourful from the first bite and meat is juicy, succulent and fresh.
Chicken noodles is very subtle and at the same time very tasty.. Noodles looked freshly boiled and the veggies are as fresh as they can be.. :D You won't get this kind of flavour and taste to the noodles at many places.
Tried sushi for the first time.. It was served with a green pickle which is super spicy (a pinch of it can actually make you cry) and pickled ginger.. felt sushi is not made for my palate.. :D forgot to mention had hard time to eat with chopsticks.. finally had with fork and spoon.. LOL..

I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!

It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet.",1,2 Reviews,3/31/2019 13:15,1,

Packaging was superb.. they put in dry-ice to keep it cool. Appreciate the effort.

Edit:
Orered hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream. Once again, the packaging was very thoughtful; they sent two separate packages for the hot brownie and ice-cream (with dry ice to keep it cool).
It tasted very delicious... quantity was ample; couldn't finish it alone! It's good enough as dessert for 2 people.

We cancelled the order and walked away.

Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.

Profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. Not the other way around.

Amul has an outlet near DLF CyberCity Gate 2, Gachibowli which is fully crowded on the weekends. This place is small and has less number of tables available. It is decorated with the lights and the loud music plays in the background. People love to enjoy desserts here after having the street food at DLF.
They serve a large variety of ice creams, brownies, sundae etc. We ordered Belgian Chocolate, Rajbhog and Kesar Pista ice creams cost near INR 75. All of them were delicious and mouth watering. Service was quite slow, as they had many online orders in a queue.

Very arrogant and rude staff. The order took forever to come. Not sure if this is a Saturday night rush issue or a regular thing. 
When our order finally arrived, they got it wrong.
The dance floor was very crowded and some people were pushing us.

The only good part was 2+2 with zomato gold.

In the final bill, they charged us for 6 extra drinks and refused to update bill.

1. Budweiser (3)
2. Virgin Mojito (2) - It was soooooo good.
3. Chicken Tikka - Could have cooked more.
4. Crispy chicken Asian Style
5. Dragon Chicken
6. Chicken pulao - Same as Biryani nothing great

2496,SKYHY,Himakar Yv,"TLDR : an avg place with  moderately expensive drinks  ( a LIT in pictures at 550  ) A nice club with good ambiance , but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a SATURDAY night . It was a happening place earlier , which couldn't cope up with new upcoming competition around it . The chicken wings were undercooked . The only good thing about the place was the energetic DJ with crazy numbers & the dance floor . The staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me & another blogger from taking pictures & videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstyle/food bloggers (maybe they might have had a misconception initially ) .",2,"49 Reviews , 284 Followers",9/20/2018 16:30,2,

Watermelon martini for me and Bacardi for my better half with some pork spare ribs was our order. Martini was well made to my liking. The ribs had only one rib and rest were chunky pieces which we pointed out. But it was well made in spicy siracha sauce which kind of compensated.

Starters are good but main course is really horrible. Very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. The staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. You can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. The complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.

We had veg spring rolls, veg manchurian and chicken balls. All were great and I have ordered Long Island Iced tea which they made perfect.

On Wednesdays they have a guest DJ Maddy who plays super awesome tracks and in house DJ Akso is great too.

2540,Tiki Shack,Amlan Jena,"Looking for a place filled with crazy people with affordable drinks and upbeat music? Tiki Shack is the place for you. Located on roof top in Indra Nagar , you get a good view of tall office buildings that have crowded Gachibowlli and Hi-Tech City. The place is dimly lit, but I guess that is on purpose to set up the mood and if you are a party animal you are most surely going to get engrossed by the music in no time. The DJ plays all the trending tunes and it is sure to make you sway. The staff is courteous and prompt , despite the high density of crowd that gathers here during weekends. The food is quite affordable and also appeals to the taste buds at the same time. I have visited this place 3-4 times and have never been disappointed.

Aloo Pakode - 3.5/5 - Pretty normal with a homely taste to it

As soon as I entered the first response from a person (Nikhil) at the front desk was ""Stag not allowed"". When I showed my phone and explained that I did call to do the booking, he said no. I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience.

SHIT-FIT ‚Äì So Happy Its Thursday cuz Friday Is Tomorrow..!!

While we hit the weekend and everyone looking at places to hang out, I would like to share my recent experience with TiKi Shack - Rooftop Bar, Gachibowli where I have organized my team party which can serve you as a recommendation if still planning .. Such a pulsating d√©cor they got especially the blazing umbrella shaped roofing that sets the party vibe and takes you on. Their open rooftop gives a great evening view over food and drinks. This place can accommodate up to 200-300 pax (both sitting and standing crowd). Unlike many places around Gachibowli, Tikki Shack has got reasonable pricing (cost for 2 at 800-1000INR including alcohol) which answers the overcrowded weekends of this place. No Separate dance floor but the place opp to the bar counter turns out to be, after a while when the spirits go high.

We negotiated for a party package which needs a minimum of 20-25 pax to accommodate with at least 1 day prior notice/reservation priced at 1100 per person all-inclusive (has the flexibility to customise package and price depends accordingly). The menu includes Unlimited 3 Veg and Non-veg starters, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Pizza, 1 Veg and Non-Veg Biryani, 2 desserts, three varieties of mocktails (for teetotalers), draught beer/kingfisher ultra/premium (for people who drink). With least expectation, food esp starters turned out to be outstanding. Full house and the service was still attentive needs a special Mention.

Overall a satisfactory experience and I would highly recommend this place for all kinds of parties.

Kindly bare with the poor photography.

After 2 months I recently went again for an office party with ~40 people and it turned out to be a better experience. Starters [chilli chicken, fries, cheese poppers, some fish] were fine but nothing extra-ordinary, ambience was a bit crazy with random groups dancing here & there, DJ was average, Biryani was good I heard but did not try it myself. Pizza was a big let down both in taste & presentation, it was served cut into small rectangular pieces. Service was decent. Staff courteous. Good interiors.

2555,Tiki Shack,Siddharth Gopalam,"I've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time. Well, what can I say, Mustang is much better-They offer everything in the menu. I never expected that I'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in HYD, but I really can't help it this time. Work this out asap.",1,"5 Reviews , 86 Followers",4/4/2019 22:55,0,

The service was a little slow, but quite understandable given the crowd that kept pouring in till late in the night

Food that we ordered - 
1. MASALA PEEENAT  - your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices. Decent munching

2. MASALA LIJJAT - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

6.  FRIES - good old classic salted fries! :)

2570,Tiki Shack,Manoj Gangwar,"I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends
We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread.

2597,Tiki Shack,HungerDaddy,"Tiki Shak, Gachibowli - Hyderabad

The Gachibowli branch ofthis amazing pub was perhaps my best visit for having drinks, chit chat and dance with my group.

The place is only and solely for party animals, completely spacious with both indoor and outdoor seating. They have these amazing orange bulbs hanging from cane baskets on the ceiling and candlelit high seat tables.

The best time to go here is on Friday night after work, or when you feel claustrophobic at other pubs since the outdoor seating is breezy, plus there's live music by a DJ, live entertainment and wifi. So,dance at this spacious place without having to worry about bumping into your neighbours' feet.

Among drink they have everything from the regular combos of vodkas, regular margaritas, beer to Desi and angrezi whiskey. If you want to try something different after work, then do try their Helmet pop (for INR 980 - which is an experience in itself). This involves finishing your drinks bottoms up with a helmet that gets smashed with every glass you gulp.

For food, try their Chilli Cheese Toast, finger chips, Chilli chicken, masala peanuts and spring rolls. The prices are really pocket friendly.

Food is average to be honest. The french fries and nachos items could have been way better. Chicken tikka pizza was pretty bland. Chilli fish was really good though.
My friends had sex on the beach cocktail and i had virgin mojito mocktail and i must say, both of them were amazing. I had the mint cooler too and i liked virgin mojito better. Definitely worth a try.

So we just planned out of the blue, to go to a place. Mustang was on the way and we stopped there. Since it was a weekday, we got the top most seating. **Yeah, they have 3 levels of seating. And even the music was not too loud.
Addition to this, coincidentally it was an almost full moon. Everything was set for 'yeh raatein yeh mausam... No 'nadi ka keenara'üò£, but there was 'chanchal hawa' üò¨

Too dramatic??- I know ü§£
Anyway, so we had the topmost seating, and had this amazing, unobstructed view of the clean dark sky with an almost full moon. Could see the road stretched alongside with redlamps of cars.
Don't exactly remember the name of the cocktail, but I think it was wallbanger. And it will get you to bang the wall. üòú Didn't have food, so can't comment. But from other tables, it was smelling delicious. A bit heavy on the pockets. But for the view it provides, worth it.

So, if it's all so good, y one star less? Here goes the answer. All was well until we were about to head out and I decided to go to the little girls room. And guess what..!! I got locked from outside üò≠. Though, after I knocked on the door 3-4 times, they did open it, but how much ever I spent on the cocktails, was drained out with my conscious mind shaking me up with the realization that I was locked.

It's a happening place during weekends, not so much during weekdays, but I have never seen it overcrowded (which is why I love it so much).

2748,"3B's - Buddies, Bar & Barbecue",Bala Krishna,"Not worth it at all. Paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place

One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad

The biryani was properly packed. And was warm enough to eat too. It had a really good taste that other places with veg biryani don't. It's really different. And its very tasty.

2821,Behrouz Biryani,Khaane_mey_kya_hey By Rony Samuel,"Well this is an absolute honest review from a hardcore Hyderabadi and a true foodie.. I understand a lot of people complain about behrouz biryani but here's my review, behrouz is not a Hyderabadi biryani and is unique in itself and the brand claims it's biryani not being local.

I might not like it to the core as an Hyderabadi but as a food critique I don't have any complaints.. it's unique in it's preparation, was absolutely mild, ordered chicken lazeez biryani which had juicy chicken pieces, the quantity was sufficient for two moderate eaters, was aromatic and we'll garnished with dry fruits.

Felt the flavour was somewhere between a regular biryani and Mandi, now this review even holds strong backing as I had a Irani friend who liked it as well.

Really loved the packaging and the complimentary desert. The gulab jamun definitely killed the joy at the end, did regret eating it..and the mint raitha can definitely do be improved.

Firstly, packaging was good, seemed like a gift box with cutlery and mouth freshener. Then, coming to biryani, Aroma was pleasant and circulated over the entire room within no time. Chicken pieces were well cooked and melted in the mouth. Biryani tasted sweet, even with lots of masala, unlike the other conventional Hyderabadi spicy ones. Two add-On options available, Mirchi salan and mint raitha to order as required. Quantity and quality of rice is good.

2863,Behrouz Biryani,Ankita Shilpa,"I had ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biriyani from Behrouz Biriyani. The packaging really impressed me, because in case of Biriyani when it is present in a bowl, it is tough to eat it directly from that, but Behrouz serves it in a plate kinda aluminum box, with the necessary cutleries attached, and the flat feature enables the consumer to have each spoon flavourful with no spices left out. Then about the taste of the Biriyani, well it wasn't exactly up to my expectations, as my personal choice of Biriyani is the one with the ittar aroma and spices as well, but this one had spices which tasted sweet. So it was basically a SWEET Biriyani. The chicken pieces were small and many, like big chunks, but were good. Mint raita was also impressive. If you have a sweet tooth in main courses too, then you can go for this Biriyani.

I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby.

I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess.

Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel. Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night.

I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. 

The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.

Late night #needforfood has been taken care by this outlet in DLF for every hungry soul out der but this time I though to order it to my office for my evening hunger. I ordered vegetable cheese Maggie and it came on time and was packed in a white box like you see in a picture.packaging is ok, the spoon was poor quality, could have been stronger to hold the Maggie.The moment I open the box, people around me could smell it and it was great, looks cheesy and yummm. So was the taste, it was good, never dissapoints. Price is nominal as well which is around 50 -70 bucks for various varieties they serve. Deserves a 4.5. I haven't tried the Momo's yet, will add to the review once I try them.

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it).

Almost every main course and starter were good except the dessert - Carrot Halwa and Mango Juice(Welcome Drink). They both didn't taste good. 3.Hospitality: The Hospitality is quite good.

Very Very satisfied... Must taste from my side- Bengal fish curry and Nizami Handi..

The starters typically was in taking terms among the guests... Awsome..

2. Service- The staff was courtious and they took care of each guests personally.. It was no less than a private party, though we havn't booked the restaurant fully...but seeing the service we  were very happy... 

3. Ambience- The restaurant is cleanly decorated..not so much noise in decor... As we want a special moment and we were in doubt how to setup the environment with some personal touch, the staff themselves took the lead and asked for few items in the morning...and when we entered in the evenning we were quite surprised to see the decoration just the right.. this is called the owning of stuff... 

Kudos to the staff and management for taking our request and customizing every bit of the arrangements as per the need of the event... VERY HAPPY...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...ALL STARS...",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/29/2019 8:51,0,

We went in for the √Ä la carte. The service was a bit slow, they need to speed up on that. We ordered crispy baby corn. Usually not a fan of corn, but loved this one. Also, the masala papad was a good one. We went ahead with the main course. The kadai paneer and rumali roti were good. Would give it a 3.5/5.
Overall, a place with a different theme and calm ambience. This place is worth a visit and is also economical.

The place opens up to you with nicely set up wall decorations which says true to the restaurants name ( with a lot of pots üòâ) and amazing ambience.

Potpourri Royyala Vepudu: A south Indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). This dish had at least 15-20 prawns. The prawns were coated and cooked in spices. The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

Gongura Mamsam: Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. We found this dish too sour ( I guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy.

3029,Pot Pourri,Akarsh Prabhu,"Had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana Cuisine. 
Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani. 

The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. It looked like some home made beginner dish. It was really dry. The server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. It was above normal levels. Otherwise no special flavour. The dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, OURSELF. 
There was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

After all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place.",2,"5 Reviews , 69 Followers",4/3/2019 17:03,0,
3030,Pot Pourri,Afreen Jahan,"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",1,"60 Reviews , 16 Followers",3/29/2019 16:49,15,

3100,Pista House,Moonis Ahmed,"Living in Manikonda, this has been our go-to place for good mughlai food. If you want authentic Hyderabadi biryani, then this should be a default option. 

Have tried multiple dishes from this place so this is kind of a general review. 

The chicken biryani is their specialility. Large fragrant rice which are flaky and yet not oily provide a perfect blend with juicy chicken pieces. Only note is that they serve with one giant chicken piece in the biryani. Smaller pieces would make the biryani more manageable. The quantity is definitely something where even 4 people can easily enjoy a meal.

We tried their haleem too in this Ramzan and it was delicious. Creamy texture with generous chunks of mutton and a small spicy kick to the taste, something which I really prefer in my haleem. 

Avoid going for a dine-in given the crowd but for home delivery, this is a place where you can order anything with eyes closed.

The Haleem was very well prepared and had the aroma and taste. It was delicious! The servings of Biryani was overwhelming and very filling. The regular serving was more than one normal person could eat. But the taste was average and nothing new. The chicken was cooked well.

The ambience was good but a little too full. There's no default seating for groups of more than four people, and as we were a group of five, we had to rearrange a few chairs. The service was prompt but, understandably, very busy.",4,"73 Reviews , 184 Followers",5/22/2019 23:31,1,

3105,Pista House,Regnis Bhuvna,"""Haleem Haleem Haleem""

Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.

I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.

I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!

Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.

üëâüëâIt's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)

Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.

Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.

Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.

3140,Pista House,Girish Reddy,"Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital.

Ambiance

This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels. The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

Food quality

We ordered three items

1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot

2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff. People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues.

Pista House is bakery and restaurant having a large number of take away products available. Ambiance is quite congested because they have restaurant in the central area of hall surrounded by bakery. Also they have separate party hall available for advanced reservation.
Food-
Pista house is mostly famous for it's bakery products. Also in time of Ramzan, they serve Haleem. Pista House serves Indian as well as continental food including Chinese, Italian. We ordered Chicken burger served with potato chips and ketchup, garlic bread, chicken tangdi kebab, angara kebab and Chicken Biryani. Both the kebabs were good in taste and quantity.

They need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.

3180,Pista House,Piyush Das,"I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )

Moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places. The desserts looked sumptuous (even though I was full for them, I manged to take some pictures of them)

Not a single stand out dish , chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear. Deserts are so so. Biryani was fine but chicken was very dry , same case with the fish starter just horrible. Fruit custard had only bananas.even their water tasted like chemically treated.

3214,Marsala Food Company,Mahathi Natva,Visited this place in person and also had food delivered from it. The Mandi and the biryani are some of the personal favorites. But I happened to order the egg soft noodles from the place and it tasted really good and the quantity was pretty filling. The biryani of the place is packed with flavors and accompanied by perfectly Cooked meat.

Overwhelmed with their service and courtesy 4/5
Tasty, delicious,mouth watering 4+4 starters were served which were amazing
A paradise for Biryani lovers, never expected Biryani in main course would be this amazing anywhere else
The varieties in desserts is quite different here, which included 'KA' for all-
Double Ka metta, kadu ka kheer, gajar ka Halwa, kubani Ka metta.

3219,Marsala Food Company,Pradeep Kumar,"Well... After going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. We opted to go for buffet option. The taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that‚Äôs what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it‚Äôs ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience. I would like to suggest the management one thing, If you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don‚Äôt.",2,"1 Review , 1 Follower",4/24/2019 9:45,0,
3220,Marsala Food Company,Wagsman09,"Clean and neat place for some Arabian food as we usually get to see some unhygienic places for this cuisine and mainly Mandi.

Went for lunch with a group of ten and got to order many varieties as we opted for ala carte even though the Buffet was reasonable and had many varieties.

Mandi rice was great but chicken faham isn‚Äôt soft at all. Mushroom tikka is sweet as it contains some raisins.

Being a restaurant, as they call it (I would term it as a local tiffin centre).
They charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum ‚Äî 2 curries, 1 dal as their main course. BTW, ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special. üòÅ
Food was tasteless, their veg hara bhara kebab was stale. Earlier I felt their non veg would be good, probably the reason for the rating. But to my surprise, my foodie friends (non veg lovers) said it was worse than veg. mind you, it happens rarely with them, they can over rate any average non veg restaurant. But this was worse.

We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

We had some awesome Starters like: Arabian Chicken Soup, Paneer Papdi Kabab, Fish 65, Chicken Lahori Tikka, Golden Fried Babycorn üòã

3238,Marsala Food Company,Hayavadan Rao / The DeccanFoodie,"I visited this place with my fellow bloggers. We had all come here for lunch. A place which has been always highly rated and this visit was pending for quite some time. We all came here with a lot of expectations and Marsala Food company didn't dissapoint us at all. We tasted a lot of items on the menu. The best and my personal favorite was the kit Kat shake. It was even better than the ones you get at the other shake outlets. The lemon Coriander soup was too lemony and was a bit sour and the veg Wonton Soup was good. It is not a must try and can be avoided ! Nothing special about it ! This was the only item that wasn't very good .Deep fried panner with a lot of masala ! Undoubtedly one of the best on the menu It is a must try and the special dish of the restaurant was the fried rice . the rice is topped with few Manchuria pieces and a lot of chopped vegetables. A treat for the mouth! We also ordered the veg curry and few rotis. We were all happy with the curry and rotis . The gulab jamun and the other deserts such as the kaddu ka kher and the double ka meetha were the stars of the day. Especially the gulab jamun !
Fresh and juicy dipped in the right quantity of sugar solution ! Even the people who don't have a sweet tooth will love it! A place that is a must visit",5,"129 Reviews , 286 Followers",4/2/2019 19:07,10,

We started off with Paneer Papdi Kebab and Chilly Paneer with Crispy Corn and Veg Sheek kebab from the Veg starters. Extremely Delicious and my favorite was the Chilly Paneer.
The Non veg starters were haryali Fish Tikka ,Chilly Basil Prawns and Lahori Chicken Kebab.
The Chilly Basil Prawns were really good and perfect in every way.
The showstoppers were the Mutton Juicy Mandi and the Fish Mandi! Such a perfect taste of the Mandi rice. Can easily compete with Barkas Mandi Houses.
The Desserts, well we tried them all like the Apricot Delight , Shahi Tukda, kaddu ki kheer and my personal favourite Gulab Jamun.
The Awesome dish unknown to people who visit this place is the Kitkat Shake. Really Do try the Kitkat Shake.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.

The ambience was nice and it was very spacious with good seating arrangement. The staff is very friendly and courteous. The service is also quite fast.
We first started off with Arabian chicken soup and a Veg soup.

Then we tried their starters Paneer papdi kebab, Veg sheekh kebab, Lahori chicken kebab, Golden fried babycorn, Fish hariyali, Chilli basil prawn, Chilli paneer and Crispy corn chilli pepper.

For the maincourse we first tried Grilled fish mandi and Mutton juicy mandi. I wished mandi was more flavourful but the grilled fish which was served with mandi saved the day.
Then we tried Special fried rice with veg manchurian, Special chicken noodles with chickeb manchurian and also Veg kolhari curry and butter chicken with few breads.

We also tried few mocktails Virgin mojito, Kotkat milkshake and Chocolate milkshkae.

We finally ended our meal with few desserts Gulab jamun, Apricol delight, Double ka meetha and Kheer",5,"75 Reviews , 174 Followers",3/28/2019 12:39,26,

.
.

The place is quite good with spacious sitting area and decent ambience.
.
.
There are many varities available to eat where its mojitos, soups, starters, maincourse and the desserts not to forget the softdrinks the most important thing.
.
.
Had started with the lemon corriander souo and the arabian chicken soup....the best liked by me us the lemon corriander where the flavour of each ingeredient used to make the soup was felt in each sip.
..
..
Then the best to go with is the starters which includes the variety of eatables like fish hariyali, paneer papdi kabab which was good but less salt, lahori chicken kabab which was just awesom to have the tastiest one I had in a very long time, then comes the marg achari tikka which is again can stand against lahori kabab, then fish 65 was good , the golden fried babycorn which was so srumptious and welked fried ,then the veg sheek kabab which was the worst thing I tried honestly was not at all cooked properly no salt no chilli just wet piece of vegetables felt in mouth could not even eat that.
..
..
Then went ahead with prawns which was good ,then comes the crispy corn chilli pepper which was again a good one to go with.
..
..
The main course had the mouth waterting fish and mutton mandi which was really good but can be more organised if served more hot...the fish and mutton were cooked perefectly with soft texture felt......and not to forget the veg fried rice with manchuria again makes it fit to eat
..
..
Then had the virgin mojito and the kitkat shake which were perfectly made.
..
..
The most awaited and favourite part the dessert section
Which had the gulab jamun
The shahi tukda
The kuddi ki kheer
The khubani ka mittha.
...
...
Was happy and fulled after having this many varities of dishes.
..
..
Must visit this place to have a good experience of varities of different hyderabadi eatables.

3254,Marsala Food Company,Tummyful_hyd,"Recently we were invited for a food tasting session here at Marsala Food Company! We had heard mixed reviews about this place soo wanted to check out how it actually is! Well to start with, as soon as we entered we were quite impressed by their interiors and their seating arrangement! They have the Arabian style of seating i.e sitting down on with the food placed on stools and also they have the normal high table seating for people who don't wish to sit down! The place is dimly lit and very calm! You can enjoy the food with an overview of the traffic passing from infront of the DLF gate no 3, opposite to which is this place Marsala Food Company! So after we settled down they brought in the soups, we had the Arabian Chicken soup and the Lemon coriander soup! We just loved the Arabian Chicken Soup, it was really tasty and the chicken pieces were very tender! Whereas the lemon coriander soup was a bit spicy which is quite unexpected and also we felt it could be a little more improved! Next came vast spread of starters including both veg and non veg! The starters included Chicken pahadi, Paneer papdi, kung pao mushroom, Dragon chicken, Haryali fish tikka, Golden fried prawns, Golden fried babycorn, chilli paneer, lahori chicken kebab and mushroom moti tikka! Starters were really good in taste! Specially the non veg and seafood starters! Chicken pahadi, a dish prepared by marinating the boneless pieces in fresh mint, coriander, ginger and garlic paste and yoghurt, had a very refreshing and delectable taste! The chicken pieces were really tender and very properly cooked! The dragon chicken was a bit spicy and juicy but really good in taste! The golden fried prawns and babycorn are prepared by marinating them in the battered paste! These are really crispy and amazingly tasty! You definitely are going to love the starters here! ‚ù§ Next they brought their famous Mandis on our table which included Mutton Juicy Marg Mandi, Grilled chicken Mandi and Fish Fried Mandi! Although all of them were good enough the one that stood apart was the Grilled Chicken Mandi! The rice in the mandi is very flavorful and yummy! And the chicken is grilled to perfection making it juicy and tender! The quantity was also ample...it can serve 4! In between all the starters and the mandis they also served us their milkshakes which had kitkat milkshake, Butterscotch milkshake and strawberry delight! Strawberry was our favourite! Made of fresh strawberries this shake gives you a refreshing taste and also You will order for another one üòâ And at the end of it all, we were served the desserts...the desserts which You commonly see in the Hyderabadi functions! They had the Qubani ka meetha, Double ka meetha, Kaddu ki kheer and Gulab Jamun! We strongly feel that they should improve on their desserts! They were just okay-ish! Dessert is the way to Man's Heart...soo it shouldn't be taken lightly! But overall it was a good experience here at Marsala, the staff was really nice and friendly and the food except for the desserts was really amazing! Do try this place...specially for their starters and the grilled chicken Mandi! üòç",5,"18 Reviews , 271 Followers",3/22/2019 19:09,7,

3259,Marsala Food Company,Harshita,"The food of the place was nice except for ‚ÄòMurg Malai Tikka‚Äô, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money. The reason for giving 1 star rating is my experience in the restaurant which was not only food but also the staff which were very very rude not only while serving food but also while taking order and explaining certain dishes which were named differently on the menu. The staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in. The staff should learn how to behave with the customers.

Ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the AC could have been a little high and service a little fast. I also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around.

3262,Marsala Food Company,Jagithyala Animesh,"Visitng the place around 10 pm and the ataff was not friendly at all.

Decent ambience
Require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location",3,"4 Reviews , 1 Follower",3/17/2019 7:58,0,
3263,Marsala Food Company,Karna Nair,"Today I visited this place along with a few friends.Located at the third level of a building right opposite DLF it is at an easily reachable location.The lift opens into a foyer followed by a lobby.The dining area has many seating options both low seating and normal tables too.One can view the never ending traffic outside from the low tables.The ambience is good.The place is dimly lit with pretty lamps and decorative lights.
Now coming to the food I felt the food was mostly good with only some exceptions.
We started with soups.We had the Arabian Chicken Soup and the Lemon corriander soup.The Arabian Chicken Soup was a smooth and mild soup also it wasn't that thick too.On the other hand the Lemon Corriander soup was real thick and was more spicier and had a freshness to it.Also it had baby corn, carrots, beans and such which made it even more better.
Next we had starters.Chicken Pahadi- The pahadi kebabs have all herbs as flavouring agents instead of the normal khara masalas we generally use.The pahadi kababs they serve here is really good.The flavouring was fresh and chicken was tender and easily coming apart with a slight touch of the fork.Next we had Paneer Papdi Kebab.This is batter fried paneer slices.The batter and it's seasoning was good but inside the paneer should also have had some seasoning but the paneer was bland which spoils an otherwise great dish.Kung Pao Mushroom was okayish.It tasted almost like manchurian and lacked the normal roasted peanuts which you find generally in Kung Pao dishes.Dragon chicken and Hariyali Fish Tikka both were amazing.I do recommend these.Golden Fried prawns were good but they were batter fried which took away that 'prawn' taste.It was good but did not feel like having prawns.Golden fried Baby corn was also good.Chilli Paneer was disappointing.The paneer was not soft and the dish just did work out.Lahori Chicken Kabab was also pretty good.Mushroom Moti Tikki is something I would avoid.I did not like it but I feel this is a dish that one person might love while the other will just hate it.It is khova filled mushrooms.I could not eat it and so I am not recommending this but you could give it a try.What if you are a sweet filled mushroom kinda person.
Next we had Mandis.The juicy mutton mandi was good but my favourite has to be the Chicken Mandi.The rice of the Mandis was flavourful and filled with caramelized onions and nuts.The fried chicken served with the mandi was just pure awesomeness.The pieces are fried and then again tossed with some sauces to give it a unique taste.The Fish mandi was also served with a very tasty fried fish piece.The fish was very flavourful and is definitely worth a try.The best Mandi you ask then definitely go for the Chicken Mandi.
We also had some milkshakes- KitKat,Butterscotch and Strawberry.I loved the KitKat Milkshake the most.It had chunks of KitKat in it and is served with a scoop of chocolate icecream.The milkshakes are good but they are nothing extraordinary.
Now coming to desserts. I was not that satisfied with the desserts.The Kaddu ki Kheer was really good.We also had Double ka Meetha which I feel was too dry and a bit hard too.Also the Gulab Jamuns also could improve a bit.They were not bad but not really good too.We also had Qubani ka Meetha which was okay.
Overall I would say most of the non veg starters were good and the Mandis too are good.The desserts need improvement.The place is definitely worth a visit.",5,"30 Reviews , 63 Followers",3/16/2019 22:08,27,
3264,Marsala Food Company,Simanto Bagchi,"Customers won't really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par. I ordered Chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. The chicken tasted horrible and was stale. I had to throw away the biryani. You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here. I did not expect this kind of service and I really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future.",1,"158 Reviews , 229 Followers",3/16/2019 15:15,0,

I got my hands on their starters like

Chicken Pahadi kKebab
Chicken Banjara Kebab
Kung Pao Mushroom
Paneer Papdi Kebab
veg seekh kebab
dragon Chicken lahori Chicken kebab all the kebabs were fine what I liked the most among the starters were Kung Pao Mushroom dragon Chicken and banjara kebab and I felt that the veg seekh kebab was a bit dry and had no flavours apart from that everything was really delicious

Getting into the main course now I tried Mutton Juicy Mandi chicken Tangdi Mandi and grilled fish Mandi I personally liked chicken Tangdi Mandi as the chicken was well marinated and spicy as I love spicy food

Treating myself with the milkshakes and Desserts now in milkshakes I tried chocolate, butterscotch and KitKat I liked the KitKat one it was so deliciously topped with a scoop of ice-cream and then KitKat as a cherry on the top and in desserts I had gajar Ka Halwa double Ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer I liked kaddu ki kheer the most there was no major difference between gajar Ka Halwa and double Ka meetha my overall experience was good the staff were friendly and cooperative all I would like to say is its a good place to hangout with your friends for a proper Arabian meal !!",5,"58 Reviews , 564 Followers",3/16/2019 1:33,19,

We ordered for chicken kebabs for starter which was perfectly cooked with awesome taste and after that we ordered chicken biryani which was came up with nice quality and superb taste with good enough quantity.

Starters: Ordered crispy corn chilli pepper and Paneer papdi kebab. Was very much disappointed with the quantity they gave. We only get 4 pieces of paneer papdi kebab. It was crispy and tasty but could've used a little more spice. The crispy corn being crispy corn tasted wonderful! 

Main Course: Ordered Paneer Tikka Biryani, and Butter Naan along with Kaju Paneer. The butter naan and the curry were decent but the paneer tikka biryani was the best paneer biryani I've ever tasted. The paneer pieces were soft and creamy and the rice had a rich taste to it. Though the biryani could've used a little more spice, it tasted great! 

Ambiance & Service: This is an evening place for sure and we visited there for lunch. So couldn't really comment on that but whatever we could see looked very good. One complaint was that our seats were directly beside a bare glass and we got scorched in the sun for 40 mins before we could get a table away from it. Avoid the seats beside the glass during afternoon hours. The service was a little late but the staff was friendly. Kudos to that!

Went here for lunch and unfortunately some part of this store is not really having shades which resulted in sunlight falling on us while lunch. Did not feel comfortable while seating there, later we moved on to different table.

        Ambiance pretty normal not so catchy but i would say evenings are the best time to visit this place. Service is good, quite descent number of servers. Impressed with their work polite, calm and patient. having enough said about the service and ambiance let's skip into the food!

Veg corn soup: Touch of the sweet corn along with the hot sour soup, the veg soup tasted extremely well.

Tomato : Crispy bread crums soaked in the sweet tomato soup gives you a mouth watering feeling right when it gets to your table.

chicken soup: I would say this is the best chicken soup i ever had. Minced chicken along with the soup can give you the best taste.

Mutton shorba: Well, this is also a mouth watering dish over here, loved the taste of shorba. The hot soup served with the piece of mutton, can really make your day!!

  
Crispy Corn : Spicy enough as well as crispy enough this starter really gave us a boost! 

Chicken Spring Roll: This is where i was pretty disappointed because they failed to impress us. not really tasty though. 

Loose Prawns : Neatly washed and perfectly grilled the loose prawns were delicious resulting in craving for more.

Chicken Chettinad : well cooked well marinated with enough spices the chettinad curry really satisfied our need. 

chicken mughlai : Spicy enough, delicious enough just satisfying the need for spicy indian food, this dish never dissapoints you. 

Panner Biryani : wasn't really impressed with panner biryani though, it could do better. 

chicken Biryani: Since i am not a fan of cardamom the usage of cardamom in biryani makes me go crazy but this place and moderately put up cardamom in biryani adding it a slight flavour. I suggest it's better to ask before preparing the food.

3319,Club Rogue,Neha Choudhary,"Whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took ""Rogue"" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.

3322,Club Rogue,Sravanthi Kumsi,"Been to Club Rogue last Saturday I.e. 13th April 2019. We chose this place as it was a Bollywood night. Lot of things to get told about this place.
First, coming to the ambience. It's a nice big place. The pricing is reasonable. We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
Now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
The Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.
Overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.

3324,Club Rogue,Santosh Kumar Kabra,"Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid.",2,"1 Review , 22 Followers",4/15/2019 13:47,0,

Really bad service.

This place has a quiet weird rule. If you show your office ID card they‚Äôll not be charging a cover amount. Else you‚Äôll have to pay a cover charge.

The bar attenders are so ill mannered, I was almost about to slap one.
If you can‚Äôt talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar!
I‚Äôve asked for a Budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that I ordered kingfisher. (I‚Äôm okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).

Food was average and served medium hot (I think I was served someone else‚Äôs cancelled order item)

Music was terrible! There was some desi dj who was playing songs out of YouTube and there was no quality mixing.

This is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd March, 2019. We were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company ID, as we were stags. One of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his ID proof.
In the mean time that Manager appeared at the gate.
We went to the gate and showed the ID, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. Without any reason.
Some other stag groups were entering; just showing company ID.
But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.

The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. This was pretty humiliating. This place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to.
The food was average at best.
They entered ‚Çπ200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this s***ty service.
The valet meddled with my car's infotainment system.
I will avoid this place from now on and stick to more classy places.",1,"4 Reviews , 27 Followers",2/20/2019 22:56,0,

Place being popular amongst the crowd even on weekdays must ensure to meet the menu mentioned food items and sometimes we specially come to try those food items and also serving cold food is a big disappointment

3364,Club Rogue,Sheetal Adapa,"I am thinking where to start, there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2-3 hours of time we spent there. We were a group of 8, we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us.
To start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
Secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
The service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.
The Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said ""Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
Our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
This place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.",1,"24 Reviews , 43 Followers",2/19/2019 15:59,0,

If you order 2 beers, they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket, they will take half an hour to bring your order. The place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. Then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. Despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. Crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. Music and DJ is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller.

3375,Club Rogue,Jaideep,"An amazing place to let loose and free yourself of an entire day's/ week's slog.
Food : decently priced, huge helpings. One dish likely to suffice for two. Unless, of course... ;)
Drinks : large+ rum and hot water punched with lemon and spice for under 200. What else could one ask for? Unless, one finds better pleasure in other drinks... ;) Beer bucket prices ~900. So... Yeah good place to get the buzz.
Dance : the heart and soul of the place. DJs do a great job, generally. It's EDM untill 10pm-ish, and right mix of Punjabi, Bollywood and popular English. If you come here 2-3 days you'll figure out the pattern of songs the DJ plays. But every other day, he/she does surprise you.

Fridays and Saturdays are jam packed on the dance floor. Couples are better off dancing on the sidelines or near their table... (Just saying)

When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse. He outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us.. Really!?! LIKE REALLY???

What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business.

3407,Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Priyanka Naidu,"This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.

So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg & Non-Veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.

Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. 

1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. 
2. The livery was stained.
3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.
7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.
8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi. 
Lamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
Nalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.
Murgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.
9. And last but not the least, Dessert.
Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
Kesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. Ate 4 and went home.",1,"32 Reviews , 309 Followers",5/10/2019 16:28,0,

After ages I must have had so tasty and upto the mark Rogan Ghosh. I would be visiting again with my wife to this place and would like to spend some quality time.

It is ultimate place if you want to have romantic date with your loved one at poolside.. Basically this is rooftop place with outdoor seating arrangement on poolside with live IPL and indoor seating arrangement with some light music.loved their ambiance..

My review is based on session invite..

Soup - coconut Thai soup which was amazing..It has creamy consistency and that coconut flavor and Thai spices were enhancing it's taste to the next level..

In starter, We tried beetroot paneer Tikka which was damn good..Paneer was marinated in beetroot gravy and they barbeque it and served it with green chutney .Taste wise it was good..

Sikampuri kebab - This was show stealer dish of the day..It was stuffed with many ingredients like casher,potato, capsicum,green peas, onion, khoya, kismis and the list goes on..It was luscious..MUST TRY

Mocktails,
Mango mint - It was one of the show stealer Mocktail..The hint of mint and mango flavor was refreshing...

Apple cooler - it was sundowner Mocktail..Very refreshing..Apple chunks and mint leaves were giving fresh punch to the drink.

In main course,

Stuffed capsicum - This is one of my favorite dish from childhood but trust me nobody can beat this taste.. .. Capsicum was cooked and soft enough from outside and the consistency of stuffing was adequate.. Loved it and I would like to day plating was damn attractive..

Malai kofta - lt was presented in a big pate with small modak shape kofta with creamy and luscious gravy..Kofta was stuffed with paneer, khoya and some spices and to balance the taste gravy was little son sweet side..It lip smacking good..

In Desserts we tried hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. brownie was soft enough and sweetness was balanced..It was heavenly good .

My overall experience was amazing..chef Bhuvnesh was helpful us through out our dinning time.Mr.Nitin made our dinning experiences comfortable and memorable... I would like to mention that every staff member was so friendly and helpful too... Loved their hospitality..

I would definitely recommend this place to have a one of the best experience with food and Ambiance..",5,"151 Reviews , 2116 Followers",5/1/2019 15:44,7,

Looking for a romantic dinner? I would say this is one of the best place in Hyderabad. Amazing ambience along the poolside. My review is based on the session invite.

We started our dinner with Thai coconut soup. Perfectly cooked veggies like carrot, broccoli, zucchini dipped into the coconut milk. It was very tasty.

In starters, we were served Beetroot paneer Tikka and Sikampuri kebab. Plating was very tempting. Paneer Tikka goes really well with the chutney they served with it. And the kebab, it was the best Sikampuri kebab I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and moist inside.

In mocktails, they suggested their best sellers which were apple cooler and minty mango. Apple cooler was little tangy and minty mango was on sweeter side. I just loved the latter one. It was very refreshing.

Then comes the main course. We had Malai kofta - modak shaped kofta layered with cashew curry. Sweetness was balanced and delicious in taste. Must try with their herb paratha. We also had Stuffed capsicum - one of the famous and ultimate dish in India. If you have only curry, you may find it salty, but have it with capsicum and you will feel it like a heaven.

In dessert, I had brownie with vanilla ice cream. Brownie was nice, soft, crispy outside and moist inside.

Overall, my experience was amazing with Mazzo. Bhuvnesh - the main chef is very humble person and his suggestions were really helpful while having a dinner. I also enjoyed the service from their courteous staff.",5,"100 Reviews , 1224 Followers",4/27/2019 14:50,10,

when dining in a 5 star one cannot expect much from the food on taste basis.

by far the best i have had.

3429,Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Akshay Krishna,"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",1,"144 Reviews , 911 Followers",4/10/2019 12:31,2,

Visited this place for a rather late lunch, say somewhere around 3/4.

Ambience - Simply classic and sufficiently spacious (at least,we felt so because we were the only customers in the restaurant.) This place reeks of class & elegance from the moment you step inside the elevator. The place is brightly lit and relaxing. Though the rooftop view is breathtaking coupled with sitting by the poolside, we preferred sitting indoors.

Service - Gopal was our server for the day. Courteous and meticulous, he helped us with suggestions for dishes more suitable for our tastes. The staff overall seemed to be attentive and polite.

Food - We ordered two drinks(I can't recollect the names, sorry for that) and they arrived promptly at our table within no time. Ordered Caprese Bruschetta and Creamy Pesto Penne Pasta.
I've tried Bruschetta at other places but never savoured it the way I did here. The freshness of toppings was evident. The pasta was sufficient for two and that again, was a delight to eat. Had to rush,hence couldn't try the desserts.

I went to Mazzo, for lunch on a sultry afternoon. The view by the pool was spectacular, and breathtaking.
I could totally see, how this can be the most perfect date place.

I had a continental meal, and boy was it amazing! I had a few dishes out of the menu, and complements to the chef, Amit, for getting everything so right.

I had Indian Shorba and Fish n Chips for starters; Pork Chops and Spaghetti Carbonara for my main course; and a Brownie with icecream for desert.

Every dish was fantastic. But the Fish n Chips and Pork Chops blew my mind.

The fish was delicious, and the batter was perfect.

The Pork Chops were extremely juicy, and cooked to perfection. The mashed potato was oh so buttery and dreamy. And, how can I forget that demi-glace sauce. Beautiful!

The spaghetti carbonara with bacon was love.

Plating was just so Marriot! Elegant yet simple.

And, all of this, while sitting in one of the most beautiful places in the city.

We had made the night special and Marriott in turn surprised us with their lip smacking dishes too. We had our hands on few cocktails namely Eye of the tiger and Bull frog which kept the mood flowing for the night.
The Chicken and Thyme pasta that night was absolutely delicious as the cheese has melted really well as could really enjoy the real taste. Hands on this was the best compared to any pasta I tried in restaurants at Hyderabad. Absolutely wonderful.
Wok tossed Hakka noodles too surprised as it lived upto the name of why it‚Äôs called a Hakka. It purely means an explosion of different flavours in a noodles and it really was. At above ‚Çπ400 both dishes really is worth the money further considering the hospitality and the ambience of the hotel.

Nitin even provided me with a speaker so I could play songs during the party. There are a lot of things that could stress someone out when hosting a party, but the location and the staff were not on that list. It is a genuine relief that I had Nitin and his team to help me.

Ambience (5/5)
The location is PERFECT if you want to host a party, take someone out on a date or just relax with your friends on a Friday evening after work. Good aesthetics along with attention to detail makes this place what it is - the rooftop, the pool, the bar, the lounge chairs by the pool, the lighting at night, the city views. 

Food (4/5)
I created the food and drinks menu for my guests with help from Nitin. Mazzo has a HUGE menu you can choose from if you're hosting a party. I for one was confused with all the choices but Nitin's suggestions were well received. Appetizers were amazing and main course was pretty good. They even have the option of live stations - pasta, Mongolian, chaat etc. Overall, diverse options.",5,"1 Review , 1 Follower",2/20/2019 2:46,0,

They let us have the best spot by the pool, let us decorate, served us entree at the table and set up speakers for us play our own music! Their service was impeccable through out that night. Thanks Mazzo & Nitin for helping me to make it memorable for my sis and her now husband!

Just look at those happy smiles!

Cheers and keep up the stellar service!

I however contacted the hotel so not sure how I am supposed to inform ALL employees for a simple reservation. It was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well. The staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed.

3482,Mazzo - Marriott Executive Apartments,Sidhant Dhirsamant,"Revised Review:

It was an absolute delight to be at Mazzo. The view is something worth looking forward to. It‚Äôs probably among the best views at a restaurant that you can get in Hyderabad. After a not so pleasant first encounter, I decided to give it another attempt. And boy, this time, it was definitely worth.

We were welcomed warmly and the chef greeted us and carefully noted our preferences in food and taste. Soon after we were served with Fried Papad to nibble on and Cranberry Base Mocktail to give some company. The poolside table with that view is sure to make your evening.

A little later, the Hot and sour soup arrived. It was a tad bit spicy but it sure opened up all the taste senses to enjoy the dishes coming in later. For starters, we had Veg Manchurian and Paneer 65 served with the green chutney dip. The Veg Manchurian was a little more spicy, but tasted good anyway. And the Paneer 65 was absolute perfection, with the soft Paneer cooked in real balanced masala.

We, then got in Veg Lasagne and Veg Biryani for main course. The lasagne was cooked very differently from the ones that I had earlier. This had a very different taste, I‚Äôm not comparing in terms of better or worse, just a very different taste. And it was a delight not just to the taste buds but also to the eyes *winks*. The Biryani, as usual, was good. Accompanied with this was the Apple mint mojito which left a tingling sweet taste every time I had a sip.

The best was saved for the last. Although, we were full to the brim, I couldn‚Äôt leave the beautiful Rasmalai untouched. And of course, there‚Äôs always a separate stomach for desserts, so. 

Overall, I had a lovely evening with my sister, that day. And I recommend it for dates or business dinners, maybe even hangout with a friend or two, you‚Äôd have a sublime time, regardless of who you‚Äôre with.

Old Review:

Overall Rating - 3/5

Such a serene ambience, if only it was accompanied by some good food. Me and my sister dropped by this place one evening. I was struck with the beautiful view this place has at nights. We asked for the menu, a couple times, after which we finally got it. The menu has limited options and if you are looking for vegetarian items (like me), you hardly have a choice. We ordered in a Subz Shammi Kebab to start with. The staff took their own sweet time to serve it, but it was toothsome, which compensated for the delayed service (I guess). Due to lack of options for drinks, we settled for a Salted Lassi and a Hot Chocolate. I don't want to go into much depth, but well, they weren't great. Both the drinks had thin consistency. We then went ahead with the Vegetable Biryani, it was definitely appetizing along with the salan and the raita, but the quantity was less. 

I'm not sure if the poor service was because it was late when we arrived or some other reason. But, to be perfectly candid, I don't think I would spend the amount just to have a good view with standard food. Definitely, not worthy enough.",5,"137 Reviews , 813 Followers",1/14/2019 15:17,8,

Ordered Long Island Ice tea which was perfectly mixed and Margarita was Awesome. They served the buffet on the table while we were having our drinks. They checked with us every 20 minutes to make sure we had a good time and TASTY food. Lastly they bought a cake for my wife to celebrate her birthday. Definitely going to recommend this place for perfect and tasty food. Thank you Amit and the Manager on duty,5,"19 Reviews , 7 Followers",1/13/2019 1:56,0,

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Food here was good, only hoping for better choices.
I understand that providing buffet becomes a tedious task when everything has to be covered up under one roof so not complaining much.
Ambience wise the place doesn't have much to offer. But the staff was the sweetest.
There was this lady whose name I can't recall but she when I asked if I can get some gulab jamuns even after it was over, she made them especially for me and delivered on table.
That gesture made me like the restaurant better.

Apart from this, they had dishes like Egg Burji, Egg Curry, rajma masala, plain rice(not even fried rice), Bhendi fry, etc. Such dishes gave me a feeling that I am dining in a roadside dhaba/tapri.

If you wouldn‚Äôt mind telling me how you prepared the fish, I would like to try making some for him at home, since he enjoyed it so much.He said that he wanted to have his birthday party at here!

My son and my mom enjoyed their desserts as well. Thank you also for having the special Jamoon for my son. I tried the sea foods and prawns was delicious!

Sea foods & Soups was amazing. Buffet was mind blowing

Once again THANK YOU SO MUCH for everything! We had a great time, and you and your staff helped to make it that way! We will be back for my son's birthday! I‚Äôll be sure to let you know in advance before we come again.

3687,Banana Leaf Multicuisine Restaurant,The Greedy Hippo,"This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.

The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.

One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

While going healthy and done with enough of biryanis it was time for Ragi muda. Ordered one ragi muda, the quantity was good, properly boiled and happy to satisfy me. Have gone with many orders from this place.

Also visited their restaurant in madhapur branch and must say am very happy with the service, food and ambiance.

They have given it a old town look. Butter and Tandoori naan were amazing with the butavankay curry thick and 3 pieces of brinjal in it. Little spicy but absolutely homely food is what i can say about this place.

Again Ragi muda is my all time favorite from here, no doubt the chutney served with it is deadly spicy. But again you ask for some more ghee or take another curry.",4,"139 Reviews , 685 Followers",12/1/2018 9:03,9,

3806,The Glass Onion,Arjun,"The Glass Onion is located at a calm and a quiet place. Despite being around a km behind Infosys, the place gives it an advantage of switching away from city chaos and you needn't be bothered about finding a place for parking. While the restaurant does offer valet, but the parking area next to the restaurant is huge and you can easily get a place there.

Once you enter the restaurant you're floored by the grandness of the place as it comes as something unexpected. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. Owing to the summers, we opted for indoor seating. The tables are well spaced and there's enough distance between the adjacent tables to give you a premium experience.

The servers are well groomed, attentive and make good recommendations basis the specialities of the restaurant and after checking your preference. For starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti Kebab and Nachos. The Kebabs were well cooked and though a little spicy left a good after taste. The Nachos were light, crispy and had good amount of toppings. Despite Nachos being one of the common starters, I'd still recommend people to try the ones here.

For the main course we ordered the Lahori Paneer Combo that gets served with a small bowl of Dal Makhni and Naan/Pulao. The Paneer too tasted very good and had the right amount of spices which blended well with the Paneer. The Dal Makhni that came along with the Paneer was out of this world. It's a pity that it doesn't get served separately, but upon request the servers certainly obliged by offering another small bowl of the same. For something that's prepared so well, I feel that the patrons should get to taste more of it and would request the management of the restaurant to include it in their menu.

Finally the dessert. Tiramisu pastry. Simply no words. Right amount of sweetness, well blended flavour and that smooth after taste of coffee. After a good dinner, the Tiramisu sealed the deal for us to be one completely satisfied customers.

One small observation that I'd still like to add is that despite a good number of servers, they tend to get distracted and slightly inefficient when all the tables start getting full. Towards the end we had to remind them about the dessert and it was evident that they had missed bringing it. However considering that they were attentive and friendly for most of our time there, I wouldn't penalize the restaurant with a star but would request to keep a check on the observation and continue to maintain the quality of the food to keep ensuring repeat visits.",5,"266 Reviews , 1559 Followers",5/12/2019 18:36,7,

The food was also great. Something that good be improved is the customer service. There is a bit of delay in getting the orders.

They welcomed us with a welcome drink which was really nice.
First we ordered Screw Driver, Tropical Delight and Mint Cooler which was really good.

Screw Driver - It was a Cocktail which contains Vodka and Orange juice.

Tropical Delight - It had Orange, Pineapple, Mango and cream which taste differently. I personally liked that blend but my friends didn't. I would rate 3.8/5.

Mint Cooler - It is just normal Virgin Mojito what we gets in other places as well. Nothing special was not their. 3.5/5

For Starters we ordered Lotus Stem Galouti which was ok ok. The kulcha was bit hard so that we need to chew it more. 3.4/5

Next we ordered BBQ Roasted Chicken pizza which was good. The pizza was properly cooked but bit burned at the end which can happen. But that was covered by the taste. 4/5

Overall the experience was really good and it is located in a calm area where we can sit and enjoy with our kids or family or friends.

And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the ""Classic Mezeh Platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response.

Ambience was really good. We had experience of both indoor and outdoor dining. Outdoor dining truly outscored indoor experience.

Food was good but a bit higher on the price looking at portion size. We ordered Mediterranean platter, Bruschetta for vegetarians. The mocktails were nice.

It was couple of days before elections and apparently alcohol was not to be served. What really impressed me was that they followed rules. That's really good to see.

For main course we ordered a north indian combo, a very customised pasta and couple more things. They tasted good. Deserts were good but served delayed.

3812,The Glass Onion,Jay Mehta,"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",2,"46 Reviews , 43 Followers",5/11/2019 22:12,6,

Ordered Chicken wings- which were perfectly cooked with the right amount of flavours infused. Tempura prawns were okay. Can give it a miss. Lotus stem galouti kabab- mildly spiced, well cooked and melts in the mouth. Ordered Chettinad chicken Indian tray. It was amazing! Sundried tomatoes chicken pasta was made perfectly. Ordered Goey chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and tiramisu. Both of them were perfect.

About food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.

We ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.

With amazing music, perfect view of the golf course, beautiful seating arrangements and sophisticated ambience made the night worth remembering. The New York cheesecake (with blueberry sauce) was good, but I won't deny that I have tasted better cheesecakes before. We ordered one pizza which, was quite filling and with generous amount of smoked and mozzarella cheese was enough for two. Special shoutout to the manager and the head waiter (I apologize I don't remember his name, but he definitely needs some appreciation. I remember he said he was from Delhi and also Kolkata) who was very courteous and offered us a complementary dessert. This definitely made our night because it tasted so good. The menu might be little overpriced according to many but for us with smart selection of dishes, it was not a hole in the pocket. Overall, it was an outstanding visit.

3836,The Glass Onion,Amlan Jena,"I will start off by talking about it's ambience and location which I believe (and am sure most will agree) are it's highlights. Located inside the serenity of Boulder hills ,away from the hullabaloo of the busy city ,it offers a sense of calm. The simple yet elegant decor , is what clicked for me right from the moment I walked in. It has both and indoor and outdoor sitting. The indoor sitting though comfortable and well lit, I would suggest the outdoor one simply because of the view it has to offer. The streches of green pasture of the golf club adjacent to it and the mild breeze that blows across it , definitely refreshes your soul as you sit sipping on your drink. I visited it on a summer evening and it was a pleasant experience to say the least. Now coming to the food and beverages part, definitely a little on the bulkier side but you got to expect that from a place like this located in the midst of all VIP locality . The cocktails are good and do ask the waiter for in house food specialities which may not be mentioned in the menu. And yes they have a novel concept of High tea served along with alcoholic beverages , which is served during the early hours of the evening (4-7 pm) , with the set up they have I believe this is a must try. Overall it's a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon or evening , with family or friends.

This was my dinner night with Naina at Glass Onion, a beautiful restaurant at Boulder Hills, Hyderabad. The best thing is definitely the vast lush green golf course which gives joy and you are definitely chilling out at the finest properties in Hyderabad.
.
Let‚Äôs take the food starting right off with beer battered fish and pizza it was all perfection at affordable rates. The beer battered fish was soft and finely fried. Lovely textures I must tell. Pizza was thin crusted and we chose a veggie pizza, called Four Cheese Pizza! Yea as you wonder it has all the right mix of different types of cheese and we just loved it. A classic wood fired pizza flocks!!
.
The penne had an attractive aroma when it reached our tables, and I must say I forgot to even take a better picture before we start digging in. It was delicious and completely uplifted the mood. We surely had our drinks to give us great company and must tell ya, the Stallion a whiskey based cocktail made with passion fruit, lemon juice and grapes were simply fantastic. Make sure to use your Zomato gold in good use here.
.
The cherry on top was Apple pie our parting order, such a warm dessert served with delicious custard sauce, almond praline topped of with vanilla flavoured icecream. We surely enjoyed this dinner and this place is a great find for couples to have a romantic dinner.

There is both indoor and outdoor seating at this place. We chose to sit outside as it got a beautiful view and it was just amazing with the view and the weather.

There is quite a large selection of food from Italian, continental to Indian. We ordered for some starters from which we really like Bakchoy fry and also Malai Broccoli, chilli potato and Red chilli chicken were really nice and if you like to have some soup I would definitely suggest hi for Broccoli soup. For the Main course we ordered some White sauce pasta, Grilled chicken with Lemon Butter Garlic Sauce, Vegetarian Fried rice and my favorite Pork Spare Ribs which was just Scrumptious and beautifully cooked pork. We also ordered a cheese platter with wine and I would suggest this for the people who love to enjoy and cheese and wine.

We had less food and lot of alcohol but people who are going only to eat some food it‚Äôs really not that expensive and it‚Äôs totally worth it for the view and for the food.

We ordered Lotus stem galauti kebab, kung paw chicken, teriyaki mushroom. The starters were delicious especially the chicken. Beware of the cocktail as you might be in for some surprises.

3860,The Glass Onion,Aditya ReDdy,"It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.

We had also ordered for a Spaghetti Aglio Olio. So the Spaghetti that they serve here is wheat spaghetti we didn‚Äôt really like how it tasted. When we informed the management about the Spaghetti, they immediately changed it with Spinach Ravioli.

3864,The Glass Onion,Hungry Soul,"Vegetarian Review ~

Hopped in on a day before Holi for dinner and unfortunately it was a dry day. Survived with food that day. It's on the road to isb and is spread on a huge area with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements while is outdoor has the view of the golf course and if the weather is great, this is the best place to be. Light music playing through the night was soothing.

We ordered lotus stem galouti with cheese kulcha, Korean waffle fries, veg penne Alfredo pasta and apple pie.

Lotus stem galouti - The galouti tasted great with the flavours of Vegetables and didn't taste much of lotus stem and went well with green chutney and cheese kulcha.

Waffle fries - The waffle had lot of honey, sesame and soy and garlic with a burnt taste. The waffle wasn't crispy and the didn't wasn't that great for my taste buds.

Alfredo pasta - The pasta was creamy and had all the veggies, the consistency was good and it tasted well overall.

Apple pie - This was star of the night for me with the pie tasted great with the falvours of apple and cardamom and the icecream was cheery on the cake and the whole dessert was mouth watering and heart filling.

The staff is good and friendly, I remember being the last one to exit and they were still nice. Keep up the good service. The whole order was around 1400 bucks which is a bit expensive for without alcohol but you get a dining experience and embience so good.

The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience. The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good.

There didn't seem any effort put into the Potato wedges that come on the side of the burger. The service was good.. if only food was half as decent!",2,"23 Reviews , 74 Followers",1/17/2019 19:03,0,

1. Bull frog
2. Fanta
3. Pepper chicken bao
4. Ginger chicken bao
5. Fish and chips
6. Cajun chicken breast sizzler

The bao's are a must try. Both of them were yummy. Fish and chips were in the same category as well but this time the fish wasn't that great. Coming to the sizzler...i felt chicken was a little hard and the veges needed a pinch of salt. A little bland for my taste. Other than that everything was good.",4,"95 Reviews , 497 Followers",1/12/2019 15:21,6,

My favorite here is their Pan Fried Fish steak sizzler (if you are not a fan of sizzlers, request them and they would serve it sans the fanfare). Tried their grilled tenderloin steak as well, but it did not live upto the expectations. It was dry and chewy sadly. Their pastas are quite tasty (we tried ours in pink sauce), so are their pizzas (we tried garden veg). If you like fish and chips, try it out here, will not be disappointed. Their cold coffee isn't that great, bitter and watery (I like the creamy and balanced kind). If you like mocktails, I would suggest that you leave out the Ginger Lime fizz. It's a poor version of our limca. The mojitos here are pretty refreshing though.",4,"84 Reviews , 512 Followers",12/24/2018 23:25,9,

3958,Deli 9 Bistro,Moonis Ahmed,"Been here quite a number of times and have tried their varitey of burgers, pizzas and grilled chicken. My all time favourites have been cajun marinated chicken breast and tex-mex burger. It is just the way they cook the meat that it becomes succulent and juicy without losing any of its flavors. I would highly recommend the tex-mex burger. Delicious cheese and patty with vegetables makes one hell of a bite. Their pizzas are also taste worthy. Despite being a non-vegetarian, I really enjoyed their garden veg pizzas with their thin crusts and generous toppings. 

Besides the food, their service is quick and the ambiance is definitely something you can enjoy with your friends and colleagues even on a weekday.

Highly recommended if you are in the area near Wipro circle Gachibowli.

The quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good. Then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee.

Veggie 9 burger - 3.5/5
Deli 9 Bistro garden Pizza -4.5/5
Shawarma wrap - 3/5

Pizza was very good .It was a thin crust pizza with cheese,sauces and veggies on top of it.
Burger had a Patty with cheese and some Vegetables like cucumber,tomatoes and onions.I found the burger pretty average.

With both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.When I ordered then as well as when I went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.I can understand if it was only in the case when I ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.That was seriously not expected from Deli 9 Bistro!!!",3,"179 Reviews , 1877 Followers",11/1/2018 0:03,5,
